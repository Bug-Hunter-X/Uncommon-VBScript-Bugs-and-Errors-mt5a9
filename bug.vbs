Late Binding and Type Mismatches: VBScript uses late binding by default, meaning that variable types are not checked until runtime. This can lead to unexpected errors if a variable is used in a way that's incompatible with its actual type.  For example, attempting to perform arithmetic operations on a string that cannot be converted to a number will cause a runtime error.

Example:
```vbscript
dims = "10"
x = s + 5
```
This will throw an error because VBScript can't directly add a string to a number.

Hidden Type Conversions: VBScript automatically converts data types in certain situations. While convenient, this can mask errors. For example, comparing a string to a number might lead to unexpected results because VBScript might implicitly convert one to match the other, which may not be what the programmer intended.

Example:
```vbscript
if "10" = 10 then
  msgbox "Equal!"
end if
```
This will show "Equal!" because VBScript converts the string to a number for comparison. But relying on this behavior can make code harder to understand and maintain.

Unhandled Exceptions: VBScript doesn't have robust exception handling like some modern languages. If an error occurs, it often halts execution abruptly without a clear indication of what went wrong.  This makes debugging challenging.

Incorrect Object Handling:  When working with COM objects, issues arise from not properly checking the return values of methods or not handling errors appropriately. Failure to release object references can cause memory leaks.

Array Issues:  Improper use of arrays, including out-of-bounds access or incorrect dimensioning, can lead to runtime errors.

Scope Issues: Incorrect use of variables or functions within different scopes (e.g., within procedures or classes) may result in unexpected behavior or errors.
