Improved Error Handling and Type Checking:
Always explicitly declare variable types using the `Dim` statement with type hints (e.g., `Dim x As Integer`). This improves code clarity and can prevent some type-related errors.

Example:
```vbscript
Dim s As String
Dim x As Integer
s = "10"
x = CInt(s) + 5 'Explicit conversion
```
Defensive Programming:
Add `On Error Resume Next` blocks to handle potential errors gracefully, but always check the `Err` object to determine if an error occurred and take appropriate actions.

Example:
```vbscript
On Error Resume Next
' some code that might cause an error
if Err.Number <> 0 then
  MsgBox "Error occurred: " & Err.Description
  Err.Clear 'Clear the error object
end if
```
Explicit Type Conversions:
Use explicit type conversion functions (like `CInt`, `CStr`, `CDbl`) to ensure data is in the correct format before using it in operations.

Careful Object Handling:
Always use `Set` to assign objects and `Set object = Nothing` to explicitly release object references to prevent memory leaks. Check for `Nothing` values before accessing object properties or methods.

Array Bounds Checking:
Always verify array indices are within the valid range before accessing array elements to prevent out-of-bounds errors.

Improved Scope Management:
Use meaningful names for variables and functions. Ensure that variables are declared in the appropriate scope (local or global) to avoid conflicts and unintentional changes to values.

Comprehensive Testing:
Thoroughly test the code with various inputs to identify potential problems and edge cases.
